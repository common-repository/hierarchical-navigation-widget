Sub Post Navigation displays the child-, parent- and sibling elements of hierarchically ordered post types like pages, posts and galleries.

== Description ==
[Sub Post Navigation](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/sub-post-navigation) is a state of the art [WordPress Plugin](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/sub-post-navigation) Widget which displays the child-, parent- and sibling elements of hierarchically ordered post types like pages, posts and galleries. For non-hierachically post types the widget can display the media attachments. The Widget generates a easy customizable HTML5 navigation you can style with your own CSS3.

In the [Lite Edition of the plugin](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/sub-post-navigation) you can take a look around and you try out everything. On several places in the plugin you will find a notice that this function is included in the [Pro Version](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/sub-post-navigation) only. There is no support available for the [free Lite Version](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/sub-post-navigation).

= How the Widget works =
* The [Sub Post Navigation Widget](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/sub-post-navigation) displays all child elements of the current page (or custom post type).
* If there are no child elements the [Widget](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/sub-post-navigation) displays the sibling elements of the current page (or custom post type).
* If the post type is not hierachically the [Widget](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/sub-post-navigation) displays the media attachments of the current post.
* For Pages (or custom post types) without parent elements and without child elements you can hide the [Widget](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/sub-post-navigation).
* For non-hierarchical post types the Widget displays the attachments of the current post.
* For deeper nesting of hierarchies the Widget could display a link to the parent page (or custom post type).
* The Widget title could be replaced by the title of the parent page (or custom post type).

= Customizing the appearance =
The output of the Widget is completely customizable. In the plugin folder you can find the file "sub-post-navigation.php" which renders the output. *Please do not modify it - you would lose all your modification then updating the plugin!* Copy the file inside your themes folder (regardless of parent or child theme) and start modify it. Inside the template code your can access these vars:

<code>
$WIDGET: Pointer to the Widget object.
$TITLE: Contains the widget title.
$PARENT: Contains the ID to the parent post/page
$NAVIGATION: Contains a WP_Query object with all elements which should be shown in this view.
</code>

I know you have many questions – my mailbox is the proof. ;) But unfortunately I cannot give support for the free plugins. There is a separate support package available for the [Pro Version](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/sub-post-navigation) of this plugin. Please use it. Of course you can hire me for consulting, support, programming and customizations at any time.
